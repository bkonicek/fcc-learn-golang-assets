PASSWORD STRENGTH
As part of improving security, Textio wants to enforce a new password policy. A valid password must meet the following criteria:

At least 5 characters long but no more than 12 characters.
Contains at least one uppercase letter.
Contains at least one digit.
ASSIGNMENT
Implement the isValidPassword function. Use a loop to inspect each character in the password string to check for its length, and the presence of an uppercase letter and a digit.
